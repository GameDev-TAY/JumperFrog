This project was done as part of the "Computer Game Development" course at Ariel University.

We created a game where a frog has to cross the road without getting hit by cars. We created three lanes that simulated the road, and we created a 
spawner for each lane that schedules the object that represents the cars at some random time. We built a code that moves the cars in a continuous 
movement from right to left (or vice versa) and the player according to the input from the arrow keys. We used a trigger to check if the player was run over on the way, 
and another trigger to check if the player reached the other side successfully.
